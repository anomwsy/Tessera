Tessera Project

Introduction:
Tessera is a project that focuses on improving IT service delivery within an organization. It is a ticketing system where employees can request various IT services, such as server repairs, equipment requests, internet troubleshooting, and more. These requests are then allocated to technical support teams for resolution.

Technologies Used:
Tessera is developed using the .NET Framework for backend operations, AngularJS for frontend design. It also employs the use of WebSockets, which enables real-time data updates, ensuring that employees can stay informed about the status of their requests. Additionally, the project utilizes the following Angular packages:

Font Awesome for icons,
Flex Layout for layout management,
CookieService for managing cookies.

How it Works:
Request Creation: Employees create tickets for their IT-related needs through Tessera's user-friendly interface. They provide details about the request, such as the type of service needed and any additional information that might be relevant.

Ticket Assignment: These requests are then assigned to technical support teams based on the nature of the request and the team's expertise. This ensures that the right team is handling the right task, which increases efficiency and reduces resolution time.

Real-time Updates: With the help of WebSockets, Tessera provides real-time updates to employees regarding their tickets. This includes any changes in status, additional notes from the technical support team, and estimated resolution times. This level of transparency helps employees stay informed and reduces the need for follow-up queries.

Resolution and Feedback: Once the issue is resolved, employees have the option to provide feedback on the service they received. This feedback loop helps in continuously improving the quality of IT services within the organization.
